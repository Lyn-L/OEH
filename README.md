Unfortunately, the original code cannot be shared, due to our company's IP policy. Instead, another MATLAB implementation of OEH has been released, which details are similar to the original version, but it would be still useful and gives similar results.

This package contains cleaned up codes for the AAAI paper, including: test_OEH.m: the demo test codes trainOEH.m: function to train the OEH model constructure_data.m: function to construct the data set compressOEH.m: function to generate the hash code LabelMe.mat: a random subset of the original LabelMe dataset
